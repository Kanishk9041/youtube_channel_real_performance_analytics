# YouTube Channel Real Performance Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes real performance metrics of YouTube channels using Python. It extracts insights from video engagement data, audience behavior, and growth trends to help content creators optimize their strategies.

## 📊 Features
- **Data Extraction**: Collecting data via YouTube API or CSV datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing view counts, likes, comments, and watch time.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Identifying top-performing videos based on CTR, retention rate, and interactions.
- **Audience Demographics**: Analyzing viewer age groups, locations, and watch preferences.
- **Growth Trends**: Tracking subscriber gains, content performance over time.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting future video performance using machine learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical analysis)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
  - Plotly (Interactive charts)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning models)
  - YouTube Data API (For real-time data collection)

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains YouTube analytics data including:
  - Video metadata (title, upload date, category)
  - Performance metrics (views, likes, dislikes, comments)
  - Audience demographics (age, location, watch time)
  - Growth statistics (subscribers gained, retention rates)

## 📈 Analysis & Insights
1. **Top Performing Videos**: Identifying high-engagement content.
2. **Viewer Behavior**: Understanding peak watch times and retention trends.
3. **Growth Analysis**: Measuring subscriber growth and video reach.
4. **CTR & Engagement**: Evaluating click-through rates and audience interaction.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting video performance based on historical data.
